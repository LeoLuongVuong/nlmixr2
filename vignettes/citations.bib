  abstract = {Quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) is a quantitative and mechanistic platform describing the phenotypic interaction between drugs, biological networks, and disease conditions to predict optimal therapeutic response. In this meta-analysis study, we review the utility of the QSP platform in drug development and therapeutic strategies based on recent publications (2019{\textendash}2021). We gathered recent original QSP models and described the diversity of their applications based on therapeutic areas, methodologies, software platforms, and functionalities. The collection and investigation of these publications can assist in providing a repository of recent QSP studies to facilitate the discovery and further reusability of QSP models. Our review shows that the largest number of QSP efforts in recent years is in Immuno-Oncology. We also addressed the benefits of integrative approaches in this field by presenting the applications of Machine Learning methods for drug discovery and QSP models. Based on this meta-analysis, we discuss the advantages and limitations of QSP models and propose fields where the QSP approach constitutes a valuable interface for more investigations to tackle complex diseases and improve drug development.},

  abstract = {Pharmacometric analyses of time series viral load data may detect drug effects with greater power than approaches using single time points. Because SARS-CoV-2 viral load rapidly rises and then falls, viral dynamic models have been used. We compared different modelling approaches when analysing Phase II-type viral dynamic data. Using two SARS-CoV-2 datasets of viral load starting within 7 days of symptoms, we fitted the slope-intercept exponential decay (SI), reduced target cell limited (rTCL), target cell limited (TCL) and TCL with eclipse phase (TCLE) models using nlmixr. Model performance was assessed via Bayesian information criterion (BIC), visual predictive checks (VPCs), goodness-of-fit plots, and parameter precision. The most complex (TCLE) model had the highest BIC for both datasets. The estimated viral decline rate was similar for all models except the TCL model for dataset A with a higher rate (median [range] day-1: dataset A; 0.63 [0.56{\textendash}1.84]; dataset B: 0.81 [0.74{\textendash}0.85]). Our findings suggest simple models should be considered during pharmacodynamic model development.},

Most pharmaceutical sponsors seeking to develop agents to treat rare diseases will initiate data landscaping efforts to identify various data sources that might be informative with respect to disease prevalence, patient selection and identification, disease progression and any data projecting likelihood of patient response to therapy including any genetic data. Such data are often difficult to come by for highly prevalent, mainstream disease populations let alone for the 8000 rare disease that make up the pooled patient population of rare disease patients. The future of rare disease drug development will hopefully rely on increased data sharing and collaboration among the entire rare disease ecosystem. One path to achieving this outcome has been the development of the rare disease cures accelerator, data analytics platform (RDCA-DAP) funded by the US FDA and operationalized by the Critical Path Institute. FDA intentions were clearly focused on improving the quality of rare disease regulatory applications by sponsors seeking to develop treatment options for various rare disease populations. As this initiative moves into its second year of operations it is envisioned that the increased connectivity to new and diverse data streams and tools will result in solutions that benefit the entire rare disease ecosystem and that the platform becomes a Collaboratory for engagement of this ecosystem that also includes patients and caregivers.},

Embedded into the secure BioMedIT network, the CDW can connect to various data providers and researchers in order to collaborate on the data securely. Due to its modularity, partially containerized deployment and open-source software, each of the components can be extended, modified, and re-used for similar projects that require integrated data management, data analysis, and web tools in a secure scientific data and information technology (IT) environment. Here, we describe a collaborative and interprofessional effort to implement the aforementioned infrastructure between several partners from medical health care and academia. Furthermore, we describe a real-world use case where blood samples from pediatric patients were analyzed for the presence of genetic polymorphisms and the results were aggregated and further analyzed together with the health-related patient data in the SwissPKcdw.},

  abstract = {Ibrutinib is a Bruton tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor for treating chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). It has also been associated with hypertension. The optimal dosing schedule for mitigating this adverse effect is currently under discussion. A quantification of relationships between systemic ibrutinib exposure and efficacy (i.e., leukocyte count and sum of the product of perpendicular diameters [SPD] of lymph nodes) and hypertension toxicity (i.e., blood pressure), and their association with overall survival is needed. Here, we present a semi-mechanistic pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling framework to characterize such relationships and facilitate dose optimization. Data from a phase Ib/II study were used, including ibrutinib plasma concentrations to derive daily 0{\textendash}24-h area under the concentration-time curve, leukocyte count, SPD, survival, and blood pressure measurements. A nonlinear mixed effects modeling approach was applied, considering ibrutinib's pharmacological action and CLL cell dynamics. The final framework included (i) an integrated model for SPD and leukocytes consisting of four CLL cell subpopulations with ibrutinib inhibiting phosphorylated Btk production, (ii) a turnover model in which ibrutinib stimulates an increase in blood pressure, and (iii) a competing risk model for dropout and death. Simulations predicted that the approved dosing schedule had a slightly higher efficacy (24-month, progression-free survival [PFS] 98\%) than de-escalation schedules (24-month, average PFS {$\approx$} 97\%); the latter had, on average, {$\approx$}20\% lower proportions of patients with hypertension. The developed modeling framework offers an improved understanding of the relationships among ibrutinib exposure, efficacy and toxicity biomarkers. This framework can serve as a platform to assess dosing schedules in a biologically plausible manner.},

In two parallel studies, rats were placed on a high-salt diet and received aldosterone by osmotic mini-pump infusion over the course of 27~days. The urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR) was evaluated after 7, 14, and 26~days of treatment. Serum K+ was evaluated after 14 and 27~days of treatment. Urinary Na+, urinary K+, and urinary Na+/K+ ratio were evaluated after 7, 14, and 26~days of treatment. The TI was calculated for each drug as the ratio of the concentration of drug producing 50\% of maximum effect (EC50) for increasing serum K+ to the EC50 for lowering UACR. The TIs were 24.5 for KBP-5074 and 0.620 for eplerenone, resulting in a 39-fold improved TI for KBP-5074 compared with eplerenone. Aldosterone treatment increased UACR, decreased serum K+, and decreased urinary Na+ relative to sham-operated controls that did not receive aldosterone infusion in both studies, validating the aldosterone/salt renal injury model. KBP-5074 prevented the increase in UACR at 0.5, 1.5, and 5~mg/kg BID while eplerenone did so only at the two highest doses of 50 and 450~mg/kg BID. Both KBP-5074 and eplerenone blunted the reduction in serum K+ seen in the aldosterone treatment group, with significant increases in serum K+ at the high doses only (5~mg/kg and 450~mg/kg BID, respectively). Additionally, the urinary Na+ and Na+/K+ ratio significantly increased at the middle and high doses of KBP-5074, but only at the highest dose of eplerenone. These results showed increased TI and efficacy for KBP-5074 compared with eplerenone over a wider therapeutic window.},

Using static kill curve experiments, observing two evolution cycles, it was demonstrated that rifampicin resistance was the result of non-specific mechanisms and not associated with accumulation of drug resistance encoding SNPs. Whereas, part of isoniazid resistance could be accounted for by accumulation of specific SNPs, which was concentration dependent. Using a Hollow Fibre Infection Model it was demonstrated that emergence of resistance did not occur at concentration{\textendash}time profiles mimicking the granuloma. This study showed that disentangling and quantifying concentration dependent emergence of resistance provides an improved rational for drug and dose selection although further work to understand the underlying mechanisms is needed to improve the drug development pipeline.},

Personalizing, thus optimizing treatments, may have multiple advantages, from fewer side effects to lower costs. However, personalization is a complicated process in practice. We discuss a mathematical model of tumor growth and therapy optimization algorithms that can be used to personalize therapies. The therapy generation is based on the concept of keeping the drug level over a specified value. A mixed-effect model is used for parametric identification, and the doses are calculated using a two-compartment model for drug pharmacokinetics, and a nonlinear pharmacodynamics and tumor dynamics model. We propose personalized therapy generation algorithms for having a maximal effect and minimal effective doses. We handle inter- and intra-patient variability for the minimal effective dose therapy. Results from mouse experiments for the personalized therapy are discussed and the algorithms are compared to a generic protocol based on overall survival. The experimental results show that the introduced algorithms significantly increased the overall survival of the mice, demonstrating that by control engineering methods an efficient modality of cancer therapy may be possible.},

While frequentist analysis of nonlinear mixed effects models has a long history, Bayesian analysis of the models has received comparatively little attention until the late 1980s, primarily due to the time-consuming nature of Bayesian computation. Since the early 1990s, Bayesian approaches for the models began to emerge to leverage rapid developments in computing power, and have recently received significant attention due to (1) superiority to quantify the uncertainty of parameter estimation; (2) utility to incorporate prior knowledge into the models; and (3) flexibility to match exactly the increasing complexity of scientific research arising from diverse industrial and academic fields. This review article presents an overview of modeling strategies to implement Bayesian approaches for the nonlinear mixed effects models, ranging from designing a scientific question out of real-life problems to practical computations.},

  abstract = {Collateral sensitivity (CS), which arises when resistance to one antibiotic increases sensitivity toward other antibiotics, offers treatment opportunities to constrain or reverse the evolution of antibiotic resistance. The applicability of CS-informed treatments remains uncertain, in part because we lack an understanding of the generality of CS effects for different resistance mutations, singly or in combination. Here, we address this issue in the gram-positive pathogen Streptococcus pneumoniae by measuring collateral and fitness effects of clinically relevant gyrA and parC alleles and their combinations that confer resistance to fluoroquinolones. We integrated these results in a mathematical model that allowed us to evaluate how different in silico combination treatments impact the dynamics of resistance evolution. We identified common and conserved CS effects of different gyrA and parC alleles; however, the spectrum of collateral effects was unique for each allele or allelic pair. This indicated that allelic identity can impact the evolutionary dynamics of resistance evolution during monotreatment and combination treatment. Our model simulations, which included the experimentally derived antibiotic susceptibilities and fitness effects, and antibiotic-specific pharmacodynamics revealed that both collateral and fitness effects impact the population dynamics of resistance evolution. Overall, we provide evidence that allelic identity and interactions can have a pronounced impact on collateral effects to different antibiotics and suggest that these need to be considered in models examining CS-based therapies.},

  abstract = {Aims Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia has been associated with an increase in overall survival in non-small cell lung cancer patients. Therefore, neutrophil counts could be an interesting biomarker for drug efficacy as well as linked directly to toxicity. For drugs where neutropenia is dose limiting, neutrophil counts might be used for monitoring drug effect and for dosing optimisation. Methods The relationship between drug effect on the first cycle neutrophil counts and patient survival was explored in a Phase III clinical trial where patients with non-small cell lung cancer were treated with docetaxel. Once the association has been established, dosing optimisation was performed for patients with severe toxicities (neutropenia) without compromising drug efficacy (overall survival). Results After taking into account baseline prognostic factors, such as Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status, smoking status, liver metastasis, tumour burden, neutrophil counts and albumin levels, a model-predicted drug effect on the first cycle neutrophil counts was strongly associated with patient survival (P = .005). Utilising this relationship in a dose optimisation algorithm, 194 out of 366 patients would have benefited from a dose reduction after the first cycle of docetaxel. The simulated 1-year survival probabilities associated with the original dose and the individualised dose were not different. Conclusion The strong relationship between drug effect on the first cycle neutrophil counts and patient survival suggests that this variable could be used to individualise dosing, possibly without needing pharmacokinetic samples. The algorithm highlights that doses could be reduced in case of severe haematological toxicities without compromising drug efficacy.},

We modelled metformin's pharmacokinetic data using nlmixr and investigated SAEM and FOCEi's performance with respect to bias and precision of parameter estimates, and robustness to initial estimates. Method Compartmental models were fitted. The final model was determined based on the objective function value and inspection of goodness-of-fit plots. The bias and precision of parameter estimates were compared between SAEM and FOCEi using stochastic simulations and estimations. For robustness, parameters were re-estimated as the initial estimates were perturbed 100 times and resultant changes evaluated. Results The absorption kinetics of metformin depend significantly on food status. Under the fasted state, the first-order absorption into the central compartment was preceded by zero-order infusion into the depot compartment, whereas for the fed state, the absorption into the depot was instantaneous followed by first-order absorption from depot into the central compartment. The means of relative mean estimation error (rMEE) ( MEESAEMMEEFOCEi) and rRMSE ( RMSESAEMRMSEFOCEi) were 0.48 and 0.35, respectively. All parameter estimates given by SAEM appeared to be narrowly distributed and were close to the true value used for simulation. In contrast, the distribution of estimates from FOCEi were skewed and more biased. When initial estimates were perturbed, FOCEi estimates were more biased and imprecise. Discussion nlmixr is reliable for NLMEM. SAEM was superior to FOCEi in terms of bias and precision, and more robust against initial estimate perturbations.},

  abstract = {There are no FDA-approved drugs to mitigate the delayed effects of radiation exposure that may occur after a radiological attack or nuclear accident. To date, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors are one of the most successful candidates for mitigation of hematopoietic, lung, kidney, and brain injuries in rodent models and may mitigate delayed radiation injuries after radiotherapy. Rat models of partial body irradiation sparing part of one hind leg (leg-out PBI) have been developed to simultaneously expose multiple organs to high doses of ionizing radiation and avoid lethal hematological toxicity to study the late effects of radiation. Exposures between 9 and 14~Gy damage the gut and bone marrow (acute radiation syndrome), followed by delayed injuries to the lung, heart, and kidney. The goal of the current study is to compare the pharmacokinetics (PK) of a lead angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, lisinopril, in irradiated vs. nonirradiated rats, as a step toward licensure by the FDA.Methods: Female WAG/RijCmcr rats were irradiated with 12.5{\textendash}13~Gy leg-out PBI. At day 35 after irradiation, during a latent period for injury, irradiated and nonirradiated siblings received a single gavage (0.3~mg, 0.6~mg) or intravenous injection (0.06~mg) of lisinopril. Plasma, urine, lung, liver and kidney levels of lisinopril were measured at different times. PK modeling (R package) was performed to track distribution of lisinopril in different compartments.Results: A two-compartment (central plasma and periphery) PK model best fit lisinopril measurements, with two additional components, the gavage and urine. The absorption and renal clearance rates were similar between nonirradiated and irradiated animals (respectively: ratios 0.883, p = 0.527; 0.943, p = 0.605). Inter-compartmental clearance (from plasma to periphery) for the irradiated rats was lower than for the nonirradiated rats (ratio 0.615, p = 0.003), while the bioavailability of the drug was 33\% higher (ratio = 1.326, p {$<$} 0.001).Interpretation: Since receptors for lisinopril are present in endothelial cells lining blood vessels, and radiation induces vascular regression, it is possible that less lisinopril remains bound in irradiated rats, increasing circulating levels of the drug. However, this study cannot rule out changes in total amount of lisinopril absorbed or excreted long-term, after irradiation in rats.},

We aimed to develop a QSP framework to evaluate the effects of metformin-associated autophagy induction in combination with antibiotics. A QSP framework for autophagy was developed by extending a model for host immune response to include adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-mTOR-autophagy signaling. This model was combined with pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models for metformin and antibiotics against M. tuberculosis. We compared the model predictions to mice infection experiments and derived predictions for the pathogen- and host-associated dynamics in humans treated with metformin in combination with antibiotics. The model adequately captured the observed bacterial load dynamics in mice M. tuberculosis infection models treated with metformin. Simulations for adjunctive metformin therapy in newly diagnosed patients suggested a limited yet dose-dependent effect of metformin on reduction of the intracellular bacterial load when the overall bacterial load is low, late during antibiotic treatment. We present the first QSP framework for HDTs against M. tuberculosis, linking cellular-level autophagy effects to disease progression and adjunctive HDT treatment response. This framework may be extended to guide the design of HDTs against M. tuberculosis.},

Formulae exist to calculate sample sizes for CRTs, but they assume that the domain of the outcomes being considered covers the full range of values of the considered distribution. This assumption is frequently incorrect in epidemiological trials in which counts of infection episodes are right-truncated due to practical constraints on the number of times a person can be tested.Motivated by a malaria vector control trial with right-truncated Poisson-distributed outcomes, we investigated the effect of right-truncation on power using Monte Carlo simulations.The results demonstrate that the adverse impact of right-truncation is directly proportional to the magnitude of the event rate, {$\lambda$}, with calculations of power being overestimated in instances where right-truncation was not accounted for. The severity of the adverse impact of right-truncation on power was more pronounced when the number of clusters was {$\leq$}30 but decreased the further the right-truncation point was from zero.Potential right-truncation should always be accounted for in the calculation of sample size requirements at the study design stage.},

Pharmacological effects are, in turn, strongly connected to the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of a drug, which can be characterized and investigated using pharmacometric models. Recently, the use of pharmacometrics has been proposed to provide pharmacological substantiation of pharmacoepidemiological findings derived from real-world data. However, validated frameworks suggesting how to combine these two disciplines for the aforementioned purpose are missing. Therefore, we propose PHARMACOM-EPI, a framework that provides a structured approach on how to identify, characterize, and apply pharmacometric models with practical details on how to choose software, format dataset, handle missing covariates/dosing data, how to perform the external evaluation of pharmacometric models in real-world data, and how to provide pharmacological substantiation of pharmacoepidemiological findings. PHARMACOM-EPI was tested in a proof-of-concept study to pharmacologically substantiate death associated with valproate use in the Danish population aged {$\geq$} 65 years. Pharmacological substantiation of death during a follow-up period of 1 year showed that in all individuals who died (n = 169) individual predictions were within the subtherapeutic range compared with 52.8\% of those who did not die (n = 1,084). Of individuals who died, 66.3\% (n = 112) had a cause of death possibly related to valproate and 33.7\% (n = 57) with well-defined cause of death unlikely related to valproate. This proof-of-concept study showed that PHARMACOM-EPI was able to provide pharmacological substantiation for death associated with valproate use in the study population.},

However, aggregate data in the form of means and possibly (co)variances, as well as previously published pharmacometric models, are often available. Being able to use all available data is desirable, and therefore this paper will outline several methods for using aggregate data as the basis of parameter estimation. The presented methods can be used for estimation of parameters from aggregate data, and as a computationally efficient alternative for the stochastic simulation and estimation procedure. They also allow for population PK/PD optimal design in the case when the data-generating model is different from the data-analytic model, a scenario for which no solutions have previously been available. Mathematical analysis and computational results confirm that the aggregate-data FO algorithm converges to the same estimates as the individual-data FO and yields near-identical standard errors when used in optimal design. The aggregate-data MC algorithm will asymptotically converge to the exactly correct parameter estimates if the data-generating model is the same as the data-analytic model. The performance of the aggregate-data methods were also compared to stochastic simulations and estimations (SSEs) when the data-generating model is different from the data-analytic model. The aggregate-data FO optimal design correctly predicted the sampling distributions of 200 models fitted to simulated datasets with the individual-data FO method.},

However, there is great interindividual variability in ganciclovir's pharmacokinetics (PK), highlighting the importance of individualized dosing. To facilitate model-informed precision dosing (MIPD), this study aimed to establish a parametric model repository of ganciclovir and valganciclovir by summarizing existing population pharmacokinetic information and analyzing the sources of variability. (2) Methods: A total of four databases were searched for published population PK models. We replicated these models, evaluated the impact of covariates on clearance, calculated the probability of target attainment for each model based on a predetermined dosing regimen, and developed an area under the concentration{\textendash}time curve (AUC) calculator using maximum a posteriori Bayesian estimation. (3) Results: A total of 16 models, one- or two-compartment models, were included. The most significant covariates were body size (weight and body surface area) and renal function. The results show that 5 mg/kg/12 h of ganciclovir could make the AUC0{\textendash}24h within 40{\textendash}80 mg{$\cdot$}h/L for 50.03\% pediatrics but cause AUC0{\textendash}24h exceeding the exposure thresholds for toxicity (120 mg{$\cdot$}h/L) in 51.24\% adults.
